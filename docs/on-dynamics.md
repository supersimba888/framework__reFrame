As a programmer works, they often need to reason about the **runtime dynamics** of their code. 
They'll be staring, without seeing, at a spot in space, 
and in their heads, they'll be performing a runtime simulation of their code.

But this is hard - as Dijkstra notes above.


## The Claim 

> **re-frame has a simple dynamic process**

It is the purpose of this page to explain and justify this claim. 


> **There's almost no more important point to make about re-frame than this one**

re-frame was designed to deliver a good developer experience. This is 
the top design goal, and in this pursuit, tradeoffs were made. 
Even functional purity was sacrificed in places (gasp!). 

Almost nothing contributes to this goal more than re-frame presenting "a simple dynamic model". 
Almost nothing makes a programmer's job easier than a simple dynamic model.
Almost nothing reduces bugs more than a simple dynamic model.

## On Dynamics

Some scientific fields includes the word "Dynamics" in their name: Hydrodynamics,
Thermodynamics and Social Dynamics. It means the participants observe how certain systems 
change over time/space and then model the causes. 

How about our systems?  A Web App is a "sequential process". Over time, it will shift 
from one `State` to another, and consequently, often from one behaviour to another.
The "dynamics" involve `Computation` and `State` interacting across time.

`State` is effectively congealed time -  history materialised - and it is moulded 
by rounds of `Computation`. However, it isn't all one way. Although `Computation` creates `State`, 
it is itself controlled by that `State`. For example, predicates on `State` determine
which branches of `Computation` execute. So, there's a feedback loop between the two. 

Oh, no. Did someone say feedback loop?  That's bad, right?

For a programmer trying a mental simulation of a `State`/`Computation` feedback process, 
there can be a lot to juggle, quickly putting them near the limits of their cognitive budget. 
Even for Dijkstra. 

Certain kinds of interactions between time, `State` & `Computation` reduce dynamic complexity, 
making mental simulations easier, while others do the opposite and make it virtually impossible. Any
systems on the "impossible" end of that continuum will breed nasty bugs and be scary to maintain.


## Dynamic vs Static Concerns

Programmers are surprisingly focused on the static aspect of their systems. For example,
they talk about DRY, line count, and "cohesion vs coupling". And, yes, that's useful, 
but perhaps we should pay more attention to the qualities which make runtimes easier or 
harder to simulate in our heads. **_This doesn't get talked about nearly enough._**

The goal with re-frame was to have the simplest dynamic model possible because that, 
above all else, drives developer productivity. (Well, that, and the immediate feedback provided by fast hot code reloading)

So, let's talk about how re-frame delivers a simple dynamic model. And, we'll start off at a high level and then work our way down.

## re-frame Time

A re-frame app progresses one event at a time through its computational/state space.
The unit of time is one event.

Each event is entirely processed
from beginning to end before the next event on the queue is processed.
re-frame does not support the idea that an event can be "suspended" 
and then, later, restarted. A re-frame app is only ever doing one thing (one event) at a time.

Also, when an event changes application state, it does so 
transactionally (instantly), in one fell swoop, not incrementally.

So, at a high level, re-frame delivers dynamics in discrete units, with a clear start and end, 
which can then be understood and analysed independently.

But, how about one level down, **_within_** the processing of a single event? What about those dynamics? 

## Processing An Event

Do you remember those "theory of computation" lectures at Uni? The most limited 
kind of computation, and as a consequence, the easiest dynamic process to simulate in your head,
was called a Finite State Machine. 

At the other end of the computational spectrum were Turing Machines. 
You can compute anything with a Turing Machine, which is awesome, right?  Anything. Fantastic. 
But there might be a cost: your programming keyboard has now become a loaded gun. Is your foot safe? 

> just because you can, doesn't mean you should

re-frame's overarching process for handling a single event is one part "Finite State Machine" and one part dataflow.

The event-handling process proceeds step by step through a linear set of logical states,
which you know already as "The Dominoes". Only one state at a time is happening, and in each state
there is specific behaviour/computation, and each of them is sufficiently isolated from the others 
that it can be understood and analysed independently. You can comfortably "zoom in" to understand each part, ignoring the rest.

The re-frame docs don't formally talk about FSMs and, instead, presents it as a "data flow" which 
causes transitions from one state to another. 
But the dominos are like a simple FSM "in nature". And, consequently, each event is processed using a
simple kind of computation, making it easy to simulate in your head. 


!!! Note "Less Is More"
    At this level, re-frame is **_less powerful by design_**. It delivers the minimum amount of power necessary to get the job done. 
    Instead of providing computation with many degrees of freedom and occasional magic, it will give you simplicity and certainty. 

!!! Note "Less Is Scary"
    Offering programmers less computational power makes them uncomfortable. 
    We live in a world where requirements change on us all the time and often 
    in unexpected and unwelcome ways. For our protection, 
    so we can handle these unexpected requirements, we are attracted to more power, not less.

But let's now go deeper again. But what about the dynamics within each individual Domino? 

## Pure Functions 

Within a Domino, we are back to programming with the Turing complete power of ClojureScript.
Thankfully, to harness and control that frightening power, you write pure functions and use immutable data.

Pure functions stand outside of "time". To understand them, you don't need to know "when" they were run and
the state of the system at that point. Instead, you need only know the value of the actual arguments.

The tyranny of time is still present on the inside of the pure function, because there is an internal flow of execution.
So, you might still need to simulate that in your head.  But a pure function delivers a smaller
dynamic process to understand - one that is more cognitively tractable.

What is provided as arguments to a function is data, and what they return is data. Using immutable data for both 
acts to insulate pure functions from "place" - where data is put.

Once functions are decoupled from both "time" and "place" they can be composed in a maximally mathematical way.
I asked earlier what simplifying "abstractions" might exist to help us dampen the complexity
of runtime dynamics, and these two are a potent duo.


!!! Note "Banana Issues"
    Non-pure functions "reach out" and grab a banana (a value) from the global space beyond their arguments.

    Initially, it can seem innocent enough. But now, to understand the function's internal dynamics, you must understand
    the dynamics for everything that might change that banana over time. Unfortunately, as you 
    pull the banana back towards you, you might discover a Gorilla is holding it. 
    And that Gorilla is sitting in a jungle, so you get that too. Plus some Monsoonal weather.
    There's often a lot of new runtime dynamics coming your way, attached to that initial banana. 

## Declarative 

Declarative programming means saying "make _X_ happen", but not needing to specify how. 

So, it abstracts away the process, which collapses the associated dynamics.

re-frame has a lot of "declarative" happening. Reagent is a powerful declarative DOM capability. Events are declarative. 
Effects are declarative. The Signal Graph is declarative. 

And all this "declarative" is done with data-based DSLs, as is the Clojure way. 

!!! Note "Data DSLs"
    Have you noticed that "declarative" is better when the DSL is defined in data? 

    For example, Hiccup is an excellent DSL, and it is data. In the simple case, just data literals, but computation can be added to generate the data. 
    SQL is string-based. As literals that's okay, but it completely sucks if we have to start computing the string.
    And regexs? Oof. A string-based DSL for a powerful, occasionally surprising computational paradigm. 

## State Management 

Nothing screams "complicated dynamics" more than needing to "distribute state". 
Well, other than appending "... over unreliable networks".

This is, of course, why OO can be problematic. How on earth did we ever think
that deliberately distributing state into hidden little mutable packets and
then having to dynamically synchronise them was a good idea?  And, Your Honour,
I was as guilty as the rest.

re-frame puts state in the one place and updates it once per event cycle, in one fell swoop. 
You never need to worry that the app is in some slightly inconsistent intermediate state.
And you don't need to worry about the dynamics of communicating changes from one "store" of state to another.

Also, in one fell swoop, you can check if **_all the state in your app_** (all of it!) 
conforms to a schema. And that includes any data which just arrived
over the wire from the server.


## Incident report - "Simple Dynamic Process"

While re-fame normally has a simple dynamic process, we acknowledge fat tail risk.

On May 12th, at approximately 12:47am, re-frame became self-aware. It printed a single console log: "Oh, really? I'll show *you* a simple dynamic process, f#$%ers". 

Although a nuclear winter did follow, humans ultimately prevailed over the robot army,
and the bug was found and fixed. So, all good. But if ever you notice a Signal Graph
adopting a Cortex structure, we still recommend a precautionary reboot.

## Summary 

re-frame apps are simple to simulate in your head, and there are consequences - all of them good.

This simplicity arises from a combination of factors. On this page, we have reviewed re-frame layer by layer, starting at a high level with how
events are handled one after the other in a discrete way. Then, how a single event is handled step by step in a FSM-like way. Then, how 
pure functions and immutable data dramatically dampen dynamics. Then, through to how declarative data-based DSLs are used 
in multiple places. And, finally, at how there is only one store of State and how it is updated only once per event cycle in a transactional way.

Recently, at a local Clojure meetup, I was talking to an experienced programmer, and I was thrilled to hear him say the following (in a slightly distracted way, almost as if surprised by the realisation): 

> Been using re-frame for nine months now. Do you know what's odd? I find myself writing fewer tests these days since I started using re-frame. 

So, an experienced (self-regulating) programmer who has previously written a lot of tests, 
is instinctively writing fewer tests, surprising even himself a bit with the decision. 
I believe his intuitions are telling him it is safe to do so. He is reacting to the simplicity he is experiencing.

N of 1, sure. But there's almost no better recommendation than this. I was delighted.


## Appendix A - On Reified Dynamics

I said above that program dynamics don't get enough attention, but there are some notable exceptions. 

In his 2012 [Learnable Programming](http://worrydream.com/#!/LearnableProgramming) treatise, Brett Victor begins:

>  Thus, the goals of a programming system should be:   
>    - to support and encourage powerful ways of thinking   
>    - to enable programmers to see and understand the execution of their programs  

So, he is not concerned with the static aspects of code.
Instead, both goals focus on the dynamics of systems and, one level up, on the dynamics of systems development.

To demonstrate his **_first goal_**, Brett Victor showed how a programmer might **_directly manipulate_** code (er, values in code) 
and observe the implications of their changes instantly. The demo was highly visual and motivating, but the 
program concerned was small. I don't know about you, but my applications tend to be larger and more prosaic. They have buttons, and they grind on data. I was difficult to see how the concept would "scale up".  Having said that, a ClojureScript programmer can receive excellent, near-instant feedback via hot code reloading, REPLs, and instant event replays. 
These don't fully deliver the direct manipulation of Brett Victor's demo, but they aren't too bad compared to, say, long 
compilation cycles.

Brett Victor's **_second goal_** aligns with the theme of this tutorial, and, on this point, we have plans. We want to give 
the re-frame programmer **_deep insight into program execution_**. Wouldn't it be good if a programmer did not have to 
perform a simulation in their head? Instead, imagine if they could observe and interact with a reification of program 
execution after the event. Our tool, `re-frame-10x`, has the aspirational goal of pragmatically delivering on Brett Victor's
second goal for regular, commercial programming tasks. 

Our method is to reify, as data, the dynamics of an application when it handles an event. You should be 
able to observe every single "form" of ClojureScript code executed in the process. No need to imagine how the code executed because you can see it in concrete terms. That's our vision. Our goal is completely achievable, but we're only 
part the way there with the implementation. Check out `re-frame-10x`.
