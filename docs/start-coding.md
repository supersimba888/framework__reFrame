## Install Clojure 

Install Clojure and Leiningen (a build tool) by following [these instructions](https://purelyfunctional.tv/guide/how-to-install-clojure/).


## Use A Template 

Create a scaffold for your first project:

  - Client only:  <https://github.com/day8/re-frame-template>
  - Full Stack: <http://www.luminusweb.net/>

## Client Only Example

Take time to review the 
[todomvc example application](https://github.com/day8/re-frame/tree/master/examples/todomvc).
It contains a lot of helpful practical advice. 

## Full Stack Example 

Take time to review a full stack application.  [RealWorld](https://github.com/jacekschae/conduit) implements to the [RealWorld Spec and API](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld).
