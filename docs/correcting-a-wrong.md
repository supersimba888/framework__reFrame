The "simple" app from the live coding walk through had a flaw. It brakes a rule.

!!! Note "re-frame Rule"
    Views should only compute hiccup. A view shouldn't process input data. The subscriptions it uses should 
    deliver the data already in the right structure, ready for use in hiccup generation.
 
The "simple" app contained this code:
```clj
(defn clock
  []
  (let [colour @(rf/subscribe [:time-color])
        time   (-> @(rf/subscribe [:time])
                 .toTimeString
                 (clojure.string/split " ")
                 first)]
    [:div.example-clock {:style {:color colour}} time]))
```

That view obtains data from a `[:time]` subscription and then it 
further processes that data into the form it needs for use in the hiccup.
We don't like that. 

## The Solution

We're going to rewrite this slightly. 

We will create a new `[:time-str]` subscription which will deliver the right data to the view, ready to go, so 
the view is 100% concerned with hiccup generation only. Maybe, like this:
```clj
(defn clock
  []
  [:div.example-clock
   {:style {:color @(rf/subscribe [:time-color])}}
   @(rf/subscribe [:time-str])])
```

So, we'll this `time-str` subscription handler:
```clj
(reg-sub 
  :time-str 

  ;; signals function 
  (fn [_ _]  
    (subscribe [:time]))

  ;; computation function
  (fn [t _] 
    (-> t
       .toTimeString
       (clojure.string/split " ")
       first)))
```

Now the subscription does the computation, not the view. Much better. 

You'll notice this new subscription handler belongs to "Layer 3" of the `Signal Graph`. 


We could rewrite it to use the `:<-` syntactic sugar:
```clj
(reg-sub 
  :time-str 

  :<- [:time]    ;; <-- this is syntactic sugar for signals fucntion

  (fn [t _] 
    (-> t
       .toTimeString
       (clojure.string/split " ")
       first)))
```

### Another Technique

Above, I suggested this:
```clj
(defn clock
  []
  [:div.example-clock
   {:style {:color @(rf/subscribe [:time-color])}}
   @(rf/subscribe [:time-str])])
```

But that may offend your finely tuned aesthetics. Too much noise with those two `@`? 

To clean this up, we could define a new `listen` function: 
```clj
(defn listen 
  [query-v]
  @(rf/subscribe query-v))
```

And then rewrite: 
```clj
(defn clock
  []
  [:div.example-clock
   {:style {:color (listen [:time-color])}}
   (listen [:time-str])])
```
So, at the cost of writing your own function, `listen`, the code is now less noisy 
AND there's less chance of us forgetting an `@` (which can lead to odd problems).

`listen` would obviously be useful in every View, not just this one. 

## LambdaIsland Naming  (LIN)

I ended up quite liking [the alternative names](https://lambdaisland.com/blog/11-02-2017-re-frame-form-1-subscriptions) 
suggested by [Lambda Island Videos](https://lambdaisland.com/):

```clj
(def <sub (comp deref re-frame.core/subscribe))   ;; same as `listen` (above)
(def >evt re-frame.core/dispatch)
```

## Say It Again

So, using you new found knowledge, if, in code review, you saw this view function:
```clj
(defn show-items
  []
  (let [sorted-items (sort @(subscribe [:items]))]  
    (into [:div] (for [i sorted-items] [item-view i]))))
```
What would you <s>leap on with a banshee scream</s> supportively object to?

That `sort`, right?  Computation in the view. Instead, we want exactly the right data 
delivered to the view - no further computation required - the view's job is to simply make `hiccup`. 

The solution is to create a subscription that delivers items already sorted. 
```clj
(reg-sub 
   :sorted-items 
   (fn [_ _]  (subscribe [:items]))
   (fn [items _]
      (sort items))
```

Now, in this case the computation is a bit trivial, but the moment it is
a little tricky, you'll want to test it.  So separating it out from the 
view will make that easier. 

To make it testable, you may structure like this:
```clj
(defn item-sorter
  [items _]
  (sort items))
  
(reg-sub 
   :sorted-items 
   (fn [_ _]  (subscribe [:items]))
   item-sorter)
```

Now it is easy to test `item-sorter` independently.  

## The Other Benefit

re-frame de-duplicates signal graph nodes.

If, for example, two views wanted to `(subscribe [:sorted-items])` only the one node 
(in the signal graph) would be created.  Only one node would be doing that 
potentially expensive sorting operation (when items changed) and values from 
it would be flowing through to both views.

That sort of efficiency can't happen if the views themselves are doing the `sort`.
 
## de-duplication

As I described above, two, or more, concurrent subscriptions for the same query will source 
reactive updates from the one executing handler - from the one node in the signal graph.

How do we know if two subscriptions are "the same"?  Answer: two subscriptions
are the same if their query vectors test `=` to each other.

So, these two subscriptions are *not* "the same":  `[:some-event 42]`  `[:some-event "blah"]`. Even
though they involve the same event id, `:some-event`, the query vectors do not test `=`.

This feature shakes out well because re-frame has a data oriented design. 

## A Final FAQ

The following issue comes up a bit.

You will end up with a bunch of `Layer 2` `reg-sub` which
look the same (they directly extract a path within `app-db`):
```clj
(reg-sub 
   :a 
   (fn [db _] 
     (:a db)))
```

```clj
(reg-sub 
   :b 
   (fn [db _] 
     (-> db :top :b)))
```
 
Now, you think and design abstractly for a living, and that repetition will feel uncomfortable. It will
call to you like a Siren: "refaaaaactoooor meeeee". "Maaaake it DRYYYY".
So here's my tip:  tie yourself to the mast and sail on. That repetition is good. It is serving a purpose.
Just sail on.

The WORST thing you can do is to flex your magnificent abstraction muscles 
and create something like this:
```clj
(reg-sub 
   :extract-any-path
   (fn [db path]
     (get-in db path))
```

"Genius!", you think to yourself.  "Now I only need one direct `reg-sub` and I supply a path to it. 
A read-only cursor of sorts.  Look at the code I can delete."
 
Neat and minimal it most certainly is, yes, but genius it isn't, IMHO. You are now asking the 
code USING the subscription to provide the path.  You have traded some innocuous 
repetition for longer term fragility, and that's not a good trade.

What fragility? Well, the view which subscribes using, say, `(subscribe [:extract-any-path [:some :path]])` 
now "knows" about (depends on) the structure within `app-db`.

What happens when you inevitably restructure `app-db` and put that `:path` path under
another high level branch of `app-db`?  You will have to run around all the views,
looking for the paths supplied, knowing which to alter and which to leave alone. 
Fragile. 

We want our views to declaratively ask for data, but they should have 
no idea where it comes from. It is the job of a subscription to know where data comes from. 

Remember our rule at the top:  **keep views as simple as possible**. 
Don't give them knowledge or tasks outside their remit.
