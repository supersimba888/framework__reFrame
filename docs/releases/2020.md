## 1.1.2 (2020-11-11)

#### Added

- Add a new interceptor called `unwrap`. It decreases the amount of destructuring necessary
  in an event handler where the `event` is structured as a 2-vector of 
  `[event-id payload-map]`. Implemented as the outcome of [#644](https://github.com/day8/re-frame/issues/644).

#### Changed

- The `:coeffects` map (within `context`) will now contain a new key called `:original-event` which has 
  as its value the original event dispatched, prior to any modification by interceptors such as 
  `trim-v` and `unwrap`.  To this another way, the `coeffects` map will have BOTH an `:event` and an `:original-event`
  key, which will reference the original event dispatched UNLESS interceptors have modified `:event`
- The `trim-v` interceptor now produces a warning if `event` is not a vector. 
  Just in case someone has mixed the use of `trim-v` and `unwrap` together.
  The `trim-v` interceptor will not modify an `event` if it is not a vector.
  
#### Breaking

- Previously, the `trim-v` interceptor stored the original event (prior to any modification) 
  within `coeffects` using the key `:re-frame.std-interceptors/untrimmed-event`. But, now, `trim-v` 
  no longer does this. Any code relying on this implementation detail will now break. Instead,
  you should access the event stored in the `:original-event` key, as described above. 

#### Fixed

- Fix reg-global-interceptor code reloading by replacing interceptors with duplicate ids in place to
  maintain the ordering of global interceptors. Previously would result in the interceptor actually
  being duplicated. See [#655](https://github.com/day8/re-frame/issues/655)
- Fix event handlers passing events modified by interceptors to tracing, instead
  all event handlers now use `:original-event` for tracing.

## 1.1.1 (2020-08-26)

#### Added

- The built-in effect `:dispatch-later` can now take a single map value. 
  Supplying a sequence of maps is now deprecated in favour of using multiple `:dispatch-later` effects within the new 
  `:fx` effect. See the [API documentation](http://day8.github.io/re-frame/api-builtin-effects/#dispatch-later). 

## 1.1.0 (2020-08-24)

#### Added

  - re-frame now guarantees that a `:db` effect, if present, will be actioned before any other sibling effects. 
    re-frame continues to provide no guarantees about the order in which other effects will be actioned. 

  - Added an new `:fx` built-in effect handler.
    Previously, you might have returned effects like this:

        #!clj
        (reg-event-fx 
          :token 
          (fn [{:keys [db]} [_ id]]
            {:db (assoc db :twirly true) 
             :dispatch [:blah]
             :full-screen true
             :http  (list 
                      {:method :GET :url "http://abc.com/endpoint" ...}
                      {:method :POST :url "http://blah.com/endpoint" ...})}))

    but now, using `:fx`:
  
        #!clj
        (reg-event-fx 
          :token 
          (fn [{:keys [db]} [_ id]]
            {:db (assoc db :twirly true) 
             :fx [ [:dispatch     [:blah]] 
                   [:full-screen  true]
                   [:http         {:method :GET :url "http://abc.com/endpoint" ...}]
                   [:http         {:method :POST :url "http://blah.com/endpoint" ...}] 
            
                   (when seventies? [:hair "side burns"])]     ;; nils are ignored
  
    Notes:
  
    - the effect `:fx` will be associated with a `seq`, typically a vector
    - the effects in `:fx` will be actioned in `seq` order
    - each element in the `seq` should be a `2-vector`. This vector will contain an effect-id, typically a keyword, and an effect payload. 
    - if any element of `:fx` is nil, it will be ignored. This allows effects to be conditionally included via a `when` (an example is given above)
    - `:db` effects should not be put into `:fx`. re-frame will emit a warning if it finds one.
  
    Benefits:
  
    - `:fx` allows for effects to be ordered
    - you can include the same kind of effect multiple times (eg `:dispatch`) which means there is no longer 
      any need for special effects like `:dispatch-n`. Indeed, all `*-n` style effects are now redundant.
    - this feature is a stepping stone towards making it easier to create an event handler which is a composition of 
      other functions. We imagine circumstances in the future in which event handlers might be written more 
      like this:
 
          #!clj
          (reg-event-xxxx       ;; <-- a new kind of registration function
            :event-id  
            interceptors 
            [function1 function2 function3])

      See exploratory discussion [here](https://github.com/day8/re-frame/issues/639#issuecomment-680500053) and [here](https://github.com/day8/re-frame/issues/639#issuecomment-682250517)
      
  
    This new effect is described in the [API docs](https://day8.github.io/re-frame/api-builtin-effects/#fx).
    Further discussion on its introduction can be found in issue [#639](https://github.com/day8/re-frame/issues/639).

#### Changed

- if your `reg-event-fx` handler returns an effect map containing an unknown effect key, re-frame will now produce a warning, not a hard error.
  See [#639](https://github.com/day8/re-frame/issues/639).
