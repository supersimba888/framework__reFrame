## 0.10.6 (2018-09-03)

#### Fixed

  - After interceptor now runs against effect db if effect db is nil/false. [#447](https://github.com/day8/re-frame/issues/447) 
  - The effect handler for `:dispatch-later` will now ignore `nils`. [#455](https://github.com/day8/re-frame/issues/455)
  - Add locking to the EventQueue when running under JVM to avoid race conditions and subtle errors when dispatching lots of events. [#471](https://github.com/day8/re-frame/pull/471)

---

## 0.10.5 (2018.02.13)

#### Changed

- Event handlers and fx are now traced, to provide more granular timing info in re-frame-trace. This has no impact on your code execution if you haven't [enabled tracing](https://github.com/day8/re-frame-trace#installation).

## 0.10.4 (2018.01.31)

#### Changed

- Interceptors, effects, and coeffects are now captured in re-frame's tracing.

---

## 0.10.3 (2018.01.24)

#### New

  - add `purge-event-queue` to the API. See https://github.com/day8/re-frame-test/issues/13 for motivation.
  - added [a new FAQ entry](/docs/FAQs/DoINeedReFrame.md) Reagent looks terrific. Why do I need re-frame?
  - added [a new Infographic](/docs/AnEpoch.md) explaining how dominoes play out over time in the browser

#### Changed

  - Debounce trace callbacks to handle larger batches of traces at once, to improve efficiency.
  - Improved error messages to not have multiple spaces before variables.

#### Fixed

  - Handle js/performance not being defined in NodeJS. [#439](https://github.com/day8/re-frame/pull/439)
  - Improve cache eviction behaviour of subscription caches. In more complex applications a subscription may have been unnecessarily created and destroyed several times after a Figwheel re-render.
