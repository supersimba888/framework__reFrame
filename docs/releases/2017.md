## 0.10.2  (2017.10.07)

#### New Features

  - On dispose callbacks now run on JVM re-frame. [#386](https://github.com/day8/re-frame/pull/386).
  - Log warnings when tracing is not enabled and you try to add a trace callback [#395](https://github.com/day8/re-frame/pull/395).

#### New Docs

  - added [a new FAQ entry](/docs/FAQs/PollADatabaseEvery60.md) How do I turn on/off polling a database every 60 secs  (hint: effects)
  - added [a new FAQ entry](/docs/FAQs/FullStackReframe.md) How do I do full-stack re-frame?
  - Added a gitbook for re-frame docs [#414](https://github.com/day8/re-frame/pull/414).
  - Lots of spelling fixes, for which we are eternally grateful.

## 0.10.1  (2017.08.17)

  - fix a showstopper bug introduced at the last minute in v0.10.0

## 0.10.0  (2017.08.16)

#### New Docs

  - added [API documentation](/docs/API.md)
  - added [testing docs](/docs/Testing.md)
  - added [a new mental model](/docs/MentalModelOmnibus.md#on-dsls-and-machines)
  - added [a new FAQ entry](/docs/FAQs/When-Does-Dispatch-Happen.md) on dispatch processing
  - added [a new FAQ entry](/docs/FAQs/DB_Normalisation.md) on representing normalised data in `app-db`
  - added [a new FAQ entry](/docs/FAQs/GlobalInterceptors.md) on how to register a global interceptor

#### Breaking

  - [#357](https://github.com/day8/re-frame/pull/357)
    I'd be amazed if this actually broke any apps. Shocked! But, better safe than sorry.
    The effect handler for `:db` has changed: if the new value provided tests
    `identical?` to the existing value within `app-db`, then `app-db` is not `reset!`.
    Previously, `app-db` was always `reset!` irrespective,
    which potentially caused Layer 2 subscriptions to run unnecessarily. So this is a tiny
    efficiency change in this edge case, and it results in behaviour that better matches
    programmer intuitions.

#### Minor Fixes and Improvements

 - [#400](https://github.com/day8/re-frame/pull/400) Improve error message when a registered cofx can't be found
 - The effect handler for `:dispatch-n` will now ignore `nils`. [See checkin](https://github.com/day8/re-frame/commit/6efdae438f393f8121a2d6dfbf76db00e6dafbf5)
 - [#340](https://github.com/day8/re-frame/pull/340)
 - [#341](https://github.com/day8/re-frame/pull/341) Fix `re-frame.core/on-changes` to work even if event handler does not set `:db`.
 - [#395](https://github.com/day8/re-frame/pull/395) Warn users if they try to enable tracing without setting the closure define `re-frame.trace.trace-enabled?`.

## 0.9.4 (2017.06.01)

#### Improvements
- added a CITATION.md file
- re-frame now supports self-hosted ClojureScript at an alpha/unofficial/experimental level. It may be removed in the future if it causes problems elsewhere. [#325](https://github.com/day8/re-frame/pull/325)

---

## 0.9.3 (2017.05.15)

#### Breaking (previously undefined behaviour)

- `reg-sub` enforces using `:<-` to indicate subscription inputs. Previously any keyword would have worked here. While using anything other than `:<-` was undefined behaviour previously, this could possibly break some code when upgrading. Thanks to [@Sohalt](https://github.com/Sohalt) [#336](https://github.com/day8/re-frame/pull/336).

#### Fixes

- `re-frame.interceptor/update-coeffect` has been fixed. [#328](https://github.com/day8/re-frame/pull/328)
- Fix ns form in `re-frame.interceptor`. Thanks to [@ggeoffrey](https://github.com/ggeoffrey). [#338](https://github.com/day8/re-frame/pull/338)
- Even more spelling fixes.

## 0.9.2 (2017.02.09)

#### Improvements

- Update dependency on reagent from `0.6.0-rc` to `0.6.0`.
- A truckload of tweaks, spelling fixes, and general improvements to the docs. A big thanks to everyone who contributed!

#### Fixes

- Use `:devDependencies` instead of `:dependencies` for the lein-npm Karma dependencies. This stops consumers of re-frame with the lein-npm plugin from having to install Karma and friends.
- Correct `:id` of on-changes interceptor from `:enrich` to `:on-changes`
