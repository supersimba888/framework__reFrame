This second tutorial on overall concepts concerns itself with Flow.

> Think of an experience from your childhood. Something you remember clearly, something you can see,
feel, maybe even smell, as if you were really there. After all you really were there at the time,
weren’t you? How else could you remember it? But here is the bombshell: you weren’t there. Not a
single atom that is in your body today was there when that event took place .... Matter flows
from place to place and momentarily comes together to be you. Whatever you are, therefore, you
are not the stuff of which you are made. If that does not make the hair stand up on the back of
your neck, read it again until it does, because it is important.
