EP

This directory contains re-frame "Enhancement Proposals" (EPs), one per file.

## Status

Each EP proceeds through the following stages:
  - **Placeholder** - skeleton at best. One day someone might write something.  
  - **Drafting** - some writing and thinking has been done, but it may be incoherent and/or wrong.
  - **UnderReview** - ready for general discussion in a specifically created (repo) Issue.
  - **Accepted** or **Rejected**
  - **Released**
