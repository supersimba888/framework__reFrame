Dominoes 2 and 3 can be written as a formula. 

```
w' = f(w,e)
```

Not writen the way a Clojureist would like to see it. 


Given the current state of the world `w`, and the occurance of an event `e`, the function `f` will compute the next state of the world `w'`.


XXX 

There's a schematic formula for Dominoes 2 and 3. 

```
w' = f(w,e)
```
