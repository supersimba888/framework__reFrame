Please take time to carefully review the heavily commented todomvc example in this repo. 

In particular, be sure to look at the [subscription code](https://github.com/day8/re-frame/blob/master/examples/todomvc/src/todomvc/subs.cljs). 

This code will provide more perspective and explanation on how to use `reg-sub` to create `Layer 2` and `Layer 3` subscriptions. Plus real examples of how to use `:<-`.
