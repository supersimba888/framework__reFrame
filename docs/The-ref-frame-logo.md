## The re-frame Logo

![logo](/images/logo/re-frame_256w.png?raw=true)

### Who

Created by the mysterious, deep thinker, known only as @martinklepsch.

Some say he appears on high value stamps in Germany and that he once <br>
punched a horse to the ground. Others say he loves recursion so much <br>
that, in his wallet, he carries a photograph of his wallet.

All we know for sure is that he wields [Sketch.app](https://www.sketchapp.com/)<br>
like Bruce Lee wielded nunchucks.

### Genesis Theories

Great, unexplained works encourage fan theories, and <br>
the re-frame logo is no exception.

One noisy group think @martinklepsch simply wanted to <br>
`Put the 'f' back into infinity`. They have t-shirts. 

Another group speculates that he created the logo as a <br>
bifarious rainbow homage to Frank Lloyd Wright's masterpiece, <br>
the Guggenheim Museum. A classic case of premature abstraction <br>
and over engineering if you ask me. Their theory, not the Guggenheim.

The infamous "Bad Touch" faction look at the logo and see the <br>
cljs logo mating noisily with re-frame's official architecture <br>
diagram. Attend one of their parties and you have a 50% chance of arrest.

The Functional Fundamentalists, a stern bunch, see the logo as <br>
a flowing poststructuralist rebuttal of OO's vowel duplication <br>
and horizontal adjacency. Their approach, FF, is apparently fine <br>
because "everyone loves a fricative".

For his part, @martinklepsch has never confirmed any theory, <br>
teasing us instead with coded clues like "Will you please stop emailing me"<br>
and "Why did you say I hit a horse?".
