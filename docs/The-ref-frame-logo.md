## The re-frame Logo

![logo](/images/logo/re-frame_256w.png?raw=true)

### Who

Created by the mysterious deep thinker, known only as @martinklepsch.

Some say he appears on high value stamps in Germany and that he once 
punched a horse to the ground. Others say he loves recursion so much 
that, in his wallet, he carries a photograph of his wallet.

All we know for sure is that he wields [Sketch.app](https://www.sketchapp.com/) like
Bruce Lee wielded nunchucks.

### Genesis Theories

Great, unexplained works encourage fan theories, and the re-frame logo
is no exception.

A noisy bunch think @martinklepsch wanted to `Put the 'f' back into infinity`. They have t-shirts. 

Others speculate he created the logo as a bifarious rainbow homage
to Frank Lloyd Wright's masterpiece, the Guggenheim Museum. A classic case 
of premature abstraction and over engineering if you ask me. Their theory, not the Guggenheim.

The infamous "Bad Touch" faction look at the logo and see the cljs logo mating noisily with re-frame's official 
architecture diagram. Attend one of their parties and you have a 50% chance of arrest.

The Functional Fundamentalists, a stern bunch, see the logo as a flowing poststructuralist rebuttal of OO's
vowel duplication and horizontal adjacency. Their approach, FF, is apparently fine because "everyone loves a
fricative".

For his part, @martinklepsch has never confirmed any theory, teasing us instead with coded clues 
like "Will you please stop emailing me" and "Why did you say I hit a horse?".
