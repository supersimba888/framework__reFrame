### Question

How do I load the data for a view, on navigation to that view? 

### Don't Do This 

The broader React community often uses a "load data on mount" approach. They 
collocate queries with view components and initiate these queries (via a GET?)
within the View's componentDidMount lifecycle method. And then, later, perhaps they
cleanup/stop any database polling in componentWillUnmount.

This arrangement is not idiomatic for re-frame. Views are not imperative 
and they don't initiate database queries. Instead, views are simply a rendering of the 
current application state. 

Please read the further explanation in [PurelyFunctional.tv's writeup](https://purelyfunctional.tv/article/react-vs-re-frame/) under the heading "Reacters load data on mount". 

### Do This Instead 

With re-frame, "imperative stuff" only ever happens because an event 
is dispatched.

When the user clicks on a button or tab to change what is shown 
to them in the UI, an event is dispatched, and it is 
the associated event handler which will compute the 
effects of the user's request. It might:
  1. change application state so the panel is shown
  2. further change application state so that a "twirly busy" thing is shown
  3. issue a database query or open a websocket

Also, remember that events should model "user intent", like 
"I'd now like to view overdue items". Be sure to never model events like
"load overdue items from database" because that's just a
low level operation performed in the service of fulfilling
the user's intent.

There's a useful effect handler available for HTTP work:

Look at the "Real World App" example for inspiration:

### Extra For Those With Redux Backgrounds

A stern reminder:
1. re-frame is event driven. It is events which move the system from one state to the next
2. events cause changes: perhaps to `app-db` or opening a web socket. These are the effects of the event
3. subscriptions simply deliver data
4. subscriptions are not imperative. They do not cause things to happen
5. only events cause things to happen and, even then, only via effects
6. views simply render the data delivered by subsciptions
7. views are not imperative. They do not cause things to happen
8. only events cause things to happen and, even then, only via effects
