### Question

When the user switches to a certain panel, I'd like to start regularly polling my 
backend (database) - say every 60 seconds.  And, then later, when the user switches 
away from that panel, I want to stop that polling.

### First, An Architectural Note 

The broader React community sometimes likes to collocate queries with view components 
and initiate those queries (via a GET?) within the View's `componentDidMount`.
And then, perhaps cleanup/stop any database polling in the Component's `componentWillUnmount`.

This approach is not idiomatic for re-frame. Views are not imperative
(they don't issue database queries), they simply render current application state.

With re-frame, "imperative stuff" only ever happens
because of an `event`.  When the user clicks on a panel-changing widget (a button or a tab?),
an event is dispatched, and it is the event handler for this event which knows 
that actions X, Y and Z needs to happen. X might be change application state so 
that the view displayed changes, and Y might be change application state so that a
"twirly thing" is shown over the top, and Z might be to issue a database query. 

So, having got that issue out the way ... 
 
### Answer 

We'll create an effect. It will be general in nature. 

It will start and stop the timed/scheduled dispatch of an event. 
For this FAQ,
we want an event dispatched every 60 seconds and each event will
trigger a backend poll, but the effect we are about to create 
will be useful well beyond this narrow case. 

We'll be creating an `effect` called, say, `:interval`. So, event handlers 
will be returning: 
```clj
  {:interval  <something>}
```
So now we design the `<something>` bit. It will be a data format (DSL) which
allows an event handler to start and stop a regular event dispatch.

To `:start` a regular dispatch, an event handler would return 
data in this format:
```clj
{:interval  {:action    :start
             :id        :panel-1-query     ;; my id for this (so I can cancel later)
             :frequency 60000              ;; how many ms between dispatches 
             :event     [:panel-query 1]}} ;; what to dispatch 
```

And to later cancel the regular dispatch, an event handler would return this:
```clj
{:interval  {:action    :cancel
             :id        :panel-1-query}}   ;; the id provided to :start  
```

With that design work done, let's now implement it by registering an 
`effect handler`: 
```clj
(re-frame.core/reg-fx        ;; the re-frame API for registering effect handlers
  :interval                  ;; the effect id
  (let [live-intervals (atom {})]                 ;; storage for live intervals
    (fn [{:keys [action id frequency event]}]     ;; the handler
      (if (= action :start) 
        (swap! live-intervals assoc id (js/setInterval #(dispatch event) frequency))) 
        (do (js/clearInterval (get live-intervals id)) 
            (swap! live-intervals dissoc id))))
```

You'd probably want a bit more error checking, but that's the (untested) sketch.

### A Side Note About Effect Handlers and Figwheel 

[Figwheel](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel) provides for the hot reloading of code, which 
is terrific.

But, during development, as Figwheel is reloading code, effectful handlers, like the 
one above, can be get into a messed up state - existing timers might be lost (and 
become never-stoppable). 

Stateful things are grubby in the face of reloading, and all we can do is 
try to manage for it as best we can, on a case by case basis.

One strategy is to put all your grubby effect handlers into their own 
separate namespace `effects.cljs` - one that isn't edited often, removing 
the trigger for a Figwheel reload. 

OR, you can code defensively for reloading, perhaps like this:
```clj
(defonce interval-handler                ;; notice the use of defonce
  (let [live-intervals (atom {})]        ;; storage for live intervals
    (fn handler [{:keys [action id frequency event]}]     ;; the effect handler
      (condp = action
         :clean   (doseq                ;; <--- new. clean up all existing 
                     #(handler {:action :end  :id  %1}) 
                     (keys @live-intervals))
         :start   (swap! live-intervals assoc id (js/setInterval #(dispatch event) frequency))) 
         :end     (do (js/clearInterval (get live-intervals id)) 
                      (swap! live-intervals dissoc id))))

;; when this code is reloaded `:clean` existing intervals
(interval-handler {:action :clean})

;; now register            
(re-frame.core/reg-fx        ;; the re-frame API for registering effect handlers
  :interval                  ;; the effect id
  interval-handler)
```

**Key takeaway:**  every effect handler is statefully grubby in its own special way. So you'll have to 
come up with strategies to handle Figwheel reloads on a case by case basis. Sometimes
there's no escaping an application restart.
