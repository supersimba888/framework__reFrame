### Question

I'm interested in taking the re-frame concepts and applying them to 
my entire Client/Server stack.  

### Short Answer

You'll want to investigate CQRS (vs REST).

##### Notes

1. Perhaps watch [Bobby Calderwood's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1-gS0oEtYc)
2. Look at his [reference implmentation](https://github.com/capitalone/cqrs-manager-for-distributed-reactive-services) or, perhaps, [this alternative](https://github.com/greywolve/calderwood)
4. Be aware that "Event Sourcing" often comes along for the ride
   with CQRS, but it doesn't have to. It adds complexity (Kafka?). 
   Don't do it lightly. Maybe just use CQRS without ES? 
5. If you do want Event Sourcing, then Kafka might be your friend, 
   Greg Young might be your God and [Onyx](https://github.com/onyx-platform/onyx)
   may be useful.
