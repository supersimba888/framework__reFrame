The re-frame tutorials initially focus on the domino
narrative. The goal is to efficiently explain the mechanics of re-frame,
and to get you reading and writing code ASAP.

But **there are other perspectives** on re-frame
which will deepen your understanding.

This section of the tutorial is a tour of these ideas. 

> If a factory is torn down but the rationality which produced it is
left standing, then that rationality will simply produce another
factory. If a revolution destroys a government, but the systematic
patterns of thought that produced that government are left intact,
then those patterns will repeat themselves. <br>
