## The re-frame Logo

![logo](/images/logo/re-frame_256w.png?raw=true)

### Who

Created by the mysterious, deep thinker, known only as @martinklepsch.

Some say he appears on high value stamps in Germany and that he once <br>
punched a horse to the ground. Others say he loves recursion so much that, <br>
in his wallet, he carries a photograph of his wallet.

All we know for sure is that he wields [Sketch.app](https://www.sketchapp.com/) like Bruce Lee <br>
wielded nunchucks.

### Genesis Theories

Great, unexplained works encourage fan theories, and the re-frame <br>
logo is no exception.

One noisy group thinks @martinklepsch simply wanted to <br>
`Put the 'f' back into infinity`. They have t-shirts.

Another group speculates that he created the logo as a bifarious  <br>
rainbow homage to Frank Lloyd Wright's masterpiece, the Guggenheim <br>
Museum. A classic case of premature abstraction and over engineering <br>
if you ask me. Their theory, not the Guggenheim.

The infamous "Bad Touch" faction look at the logo and see the cljs <br>
logo mating noisily with re-frame's official architecture diagram. <br>
Attend one of their parties and you have a 50% chance of arrest.

The Functional Fundamentalists, a stern bunch, see the logo as a <br>
flowing poststructuralist rebuttal of OO's vowel duplication and <br>
horizontal adjacency. Their alternative approach, FF, is apparently <br>
fine because "everyone loves a fricative".

For his part, @martinklepsch has never confirmed any theory, teasing <br>
us instead with coded clues like "Will you please stop emailing me" <br>
and "Why did you say I hit a horse?".
