## Who?

It was created by a mysterious, deep thinker, known only as @martinklepsch.

Some say he appears on high-value stamps in Germany and that he once <br>
knocked a horse unconscious with a single punch. Others say he loves recursion  <br>
so much that, in his wallet, he carries a photograph of his wallet.

All we know for sure is that he wields pixels like Bruce Lee wielded<br>
nunchucks.

## Genesis Theories

Great, unexplained works encourage fan theories, and the re-frame <br>
logo is no exception.

One noisy group insist that @martinklepsch's design is assertively <br>
putting the 'f' back into infinity, in a sicking-it-to-the-man kinda way.  <br>
They have t-shirts, `f u âˆž`, and angry certainty. 

Another group speculates that he created the logo as a bifarious rainbow <br>
homage to Frank Lloyd Wright's architectural masterpiece, the Guggenheim <br>
Museum. Which is surely a classic case of premature abstraction and <br>
over-engineering. Their theory, not the Guggenheim. They sometimes <br>
indent by 5 spaces - beacuse "art" - and need ultrawide monitors<br>
for yaml.

Then there's the infamous "Bad Touch" faction. So embarrassing. For them, <br>
the logo shows the ClojureScript logo mating noisily with re-frame's <br>
official architecture diagram. Colour-wise, I guess. Their parties are <br>
completely awesome, but you might need someone to bail you out of <br>
jail later.

For the Functional Fundamentalists, an earnest bunch with post-Maharishi-Beatles  <br>
hair, the logo is a flowing poststructuralist rebuttal of OO's vowel duplication  <br>
and horizontal adjacency. Their alternative abbreviation, FF, is fine, apparently, <br>
because "hey, come on man, everyone loves a fricative".  

For his part, @martinklepsch has never confirmed any theory, teasing <br>
us instead with coded clues like "Will you please stop emailing me" <br>
and "Why did you say I hit a horse?".
