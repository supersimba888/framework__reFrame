## The re-frame Logo

![logo](/images/logo/re-frame_256w.png?raw=true)

### Who

Created by the mysterious, deep thinker, known only as @martinklepsch.

Some say he appears on high value stamps in Germany and that he once <br>
punched a horse to the ground. Others say he loves recursion so much that, <br>
in his wallet, he carries a photograph of his wallet.

All we know for sure is that he wields [Sketch.app](https://www.sketchapp.com/) like Bruce Lee <br>
wielded nunchucks.

### Genesis Theories

Great, unexplained works encourage fan theories, and the re-frame <br>
logo is no exception.

One noisy group insists that @martinklepsch's design is assertively <br>
trying to `Put the 'f' back into infinity`. They have t-shirts. 

Another group speculates that he created the logo as a bifarious  <br>
rainbow homage to Frank Lloyd Wright's masterpiece, the Guggenheim <br>
Museum. Which is surely a classic case of premature abstraction  <br>
and over engineering. Their theory, not the Guggenheim.

The infamous "Bad Touch" faction look at the logo and see the cljs <br>
logo mating noisily with re-frame's official architecture diagram. <br>
Yes, its true, their parties are completely awesome, but you will <br>
need someone to bail you out of jail later.

For the Functional Fundamentalists, a stern bunch, the logo is a <br>
flowing poststructuralist rebuttal of OO's vowel duplication and <br>
horizontal adjacency. Their alternative approach, FF, is fine, apparently, <br>
because "everyone loves a fricative".

For his part, @martinklepsch has never confirmed any theory, teasing <br>
us instead with coded clues like "Will you please stop emailing me" <br>
and "Why did you say I hit a horse?".
