## The re-frame Logo

![logo](/images/logo/re-frame_256w.png?raw=true)

Created by the mysterious @martinklepsch

Some say he appears on high value stamps in Germany and that he once 
punched a horse to the ground. Others say he loves recursion so much 
that in his wallet he keeps a photograph of his wallet.

All we know for sure is that he wields [Sketch.app](https://www.sketchapp.com/) like
Bruce Lee wielded nunchucks.

## Genesis Theories

Great, unexplained works always encourage fan theories, and the re-frame logo
is no exception.

Some speculate @martinklepsch created it as a bifarious rainbow omage
to a utilities room in Frank Lloyd Wright's Guggenheim.

Others see the cljs logo folded across re-frame's official 
architecture diagram, forming a flowing poststructuralist rebuttal of OO's 
duplicate letter adjacency, and Jackson Pollock's Fractal Expressionism.

You be the judge.
