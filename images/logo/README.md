## The re-frame Logo

![logo](/images/logo/re-frame_256w.png?raw=true)

Created by the mysterious @martinklepsch

Some say he appears on high value stamps in Germany and that he once 
punched a horse to the ground. Others say he loves recursion so much 
that his wallet contains a photograph of his wallet.

All we know for sure is that he wields [Sketch.app](https://www.sketchapp.com/) like
Bruce Lee wielded nunchucks.

## Genesis Theories

Great, unexplained works encourage fan theories, and the re-frame logo
is no exception.

Some speculate @martinklepsch created it as a bifarious rainbow homage
to Frank Lloyd Wright's Guggenheim.

Others see the cljs logo mating noisily with re-frame's official 
architecture diagram.

Yet others see a poststructuralist rebuttal of OO's
vowel duplication and horizontal adjacency. Their T-shirts claim:  
> He's put the 'f' back into infinity

For his part, Martin has never confirmed any theory, teasing us instead with coded clues 
like "Will you please stop emailing me" and "Why did you say I hit a horse?".
