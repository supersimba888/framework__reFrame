## The re-frame Logo

Created by the mysterious @martinklepsch

Some say he appears on high value stamps in Iceland and that he once 
punched a horse to the ground. Others say that he loves recursion so much 
that in his wallet he keeps a photograph of his wallet.

All we know for sure is that he wields [Sketch.app](https://www.sketchapp.com/) like
Bruce Lee wielded nunchucks.

## Genesis Theories

While we wouldn't presume to know the cavernous depths of Martin's creativity, some have 
speculated that he created the re-frame logo by blending the cljs logo with re-frame's official 
architecture diagram.

You be the judge.
