## The re-frame Logo

![logo](/images/logo/re-frame_256w.png?raw=true)

Created by the mysterious @martinklepsch

Some say he appears on high value stamps in Germany and that he once 
punched a horse to the ground. Others say he loves recursion so much 
that in his wallet he keeps a photograph of his wallet.

All we know for sure is that he wields [Sketch.app](https://www.sketchapp.com/) like
Bruce Lee wielded nunchucks.

## Genesis Theories

Great, unexplained works encourage fan theories, and the re-frame logo
is no exception.

Some speculate @martinklepsch created it as a bifarious rainbow omage
to a utilities room in Frank Lloyd Wright's Guggenheim.

Others see the cljs logo folded across re-frame's official 
architecture diagram, forming a flowing poststructuralist rebuttal of OO's 
duplicate letter adjacency, and Jackson Pollock's Fractal Expressionism.

For his part, Martin has refused to confirm any theory, teasing us only with tidbits 
like "Will you please stop emailing me" and "Why did you say I hit a horse?".
