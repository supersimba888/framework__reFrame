## The re-frame Logo

![logo](/images/logo/re-frame_256w.png?raw=true)

Created by the mysterious @martinklepsch

Some say he appears on high value stamps in Germany and that he once 
punched a horse to the ground. Others say he loves recursion so much 
that in his wallet he keeps a photograph of his wallet.

All we know for sure is that he wields [Sketch.app](https://www.sketchapp.com/) like
Bruce Lee wielded nunchucks.

## Genesis Theories

While we shouldn't presume to fathom the cavernous depths of Martin's creativity, 
great, unexplained works always encourage fan theories. 

Some have 
speculated the re-frame logo was created as a bifarious rainbow omage to Frank Lloyd Wright's Guggenheim.

Others disagree and, instead, insist he visually folded (foldv) the cljs logo across re-frame's official 
architecture diagram to form a flowing poststructuralist rebuttal of OO's tyrannical duplicate 
letter adjacency.

But, are we better off never knowing?  Art requires no answer.

### Instructions
