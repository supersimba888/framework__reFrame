# Reagent example app now using re-frame

Run "`lein figwheel`" in a terminal to compile the app, and then open `http://localhost:3449/example.html`.

Any changes to ClojureScript source files (in `src`) will be reflected in the running page immediately (while "`lein figwheel`" is running).

Run "`lein clean; lein with-profile prod compile`" to compile an optimized version, and then open `resources/public/example.html`.
